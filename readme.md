# ‚öîÔ∏èüîì GladiApi Auth Retriever

A cross-browser extension to retrieve an auth object for a logged-in gladiatus character. Firefox support is nightly, as manifest V3 is, too.

## Install
...

## How to use
Start the game in your browser and log into your character. 

Once logged in, select the extension from the extension list and click it. The extension window will open and present you with an "export" button, which will download the characters auth object as a `.gao` (**g**ladiatus **a**uth **o**bject) file.

That auth object can then be used to authenticate a **GladiApi** character, until you log into the character from a different browser.
